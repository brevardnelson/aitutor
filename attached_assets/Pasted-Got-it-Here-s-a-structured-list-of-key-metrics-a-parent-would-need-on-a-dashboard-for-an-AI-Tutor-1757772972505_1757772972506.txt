Got it 👍 Here’s a structured list of key metrics a parent would need on a dashboard for an AI Tutor platform. I’ll break them down into core categories so you can design the dashboard logically.

📊 Parent Dashboard Metrics for AI Tutor Platform

1. Usage & Engagement
	•	Total Learning Time (per week/month)
	•	Average Session Duration
	•	Number of Sessions Completed
	•	Days Active (engagement streaks)
	•	Time Spent per Topic

2. Progress & Curriculum Coverage
	•	Topics Covered (e.g., Fractions, Algebra, Geometry)
	•	Percentage of Curriculum Completed
	•	Number of Practice Problems Attempted
	•	Problem Completion Rate (% of problems fully attempted vs skipped)
	•	Diagnostic Test Results (if included)

3. Performance & Mastery
	•	Accuracy Rate (% of correct answers without hints)
	•	Improvement Over Time (trend graph of scores per topic)
	•	Weakest Areas (topics with lowest accuracy or highest hint usage)
	•	Strongest Areas (mastered topics)
	•	Problem Difficulty Progression (easy → medium → hard problems solved)

4. AI Tutor Interaction Metrics
	•	Hints Requested per Session
	•	Attempts Before Correct Answer
	•	AI Intervention Needed (how often the tutor had to step in heavily)
	•	Step-by-Step Engagement (whether student engaged with guiding questions vs skipping to final hint)

5. Goal Tracking
	•	Parent-Defined Goals Progress (e.g., “Master Fractions by end of month”)
	•	Exam Readiness Indicator (overall preparedness score, based on practice & accuracy)
	•	Milestones Reached (badges, levels, streaks, completed topics)

6. Comparative Benchmarks
	•	Performance vs Class/Grade Level (if available)
	•	Time Spent vs Expected (based on recommended study hours)
	•	Score Progress Compared to Last Week/Month

7. Alerts & Insights
	•	Areas Needing Attention (e.g., “Student is struggling with Word Problems”)
